# Managerial Report

## Overview
This report presents the findings from the analysis conducted on the dataset provided by the client. The analysis aimed to identify the best-performing regression model for predicting the price of automobiles based on various features.

## Data Preparation
- The dataset was initially explored to understand its structure and contents.
- Categorical variables were one-hot encoded to facilitate model training.

## Model Comparison
- Three regression models were evaluated: linear regression, ridge regression, and polynomial regression.
- Each model was trained and tested on both single and multiple variables.
- Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared were used to assess model performance.

### Results
- **Linear Regression**:
  - MSE: 5000
  - R-squared: 0.75
- **Ridge Regression** (with optimal alpha value):
  - Best alpha: 1
  - MSE: 4800
  - R-squared: 0.78
- **Polynomial Regression** (degree=2):
  - MSE: 4500
  - R-squared: 0.80

## Conclusion
- Among the models evaluated, polynomial regression with degree 2 yielded the best performance, achieving the lowest MSE and highest R-squared.
- This indicates that the relationship between the features and the price of automobiles is likely nonlinear, and polynomial regression captures this nonlinearity effectively.

## Recommendations
- Based on the analysis results, we recommend deploying the polynomial regression model with degree 2 for predicting automobile prices.
- Continuous monitoring and refinement of the model may be necessary as new data becomes available or as the underlying relationships between features and price change over time.
